# This file governs the message conversion.
# A Receiver willing to convert a single(or multiple) message type need to expose the config as below
# Messages to be converted for reciver set 
# <ReceiverName>:<MessageType>:<ExpectedModel>

#<ReceiverName> - If similar conversions are reequired for multiple receivers, one can mention them as :  <Receievr1>|<Receiver2>|<Receiver3>
#<MessageType> - if simialr conversion is required for multiple messageTypes , one can mention them as :  <MessageType1>|<MessageType2>|<MessageType3>
#<ExpectedModel> - should be either GS1 or BYDM
 
# Below reads as - For receiver list <Wma.EAST|WMA.WEST> , list of message types <itemMessage|locationMessage|orderMessage> should be converted to BYDM model.

- 'Wma.EAST|WMA.WEST:itemMessage|locationMessage|orderMessage:BYDM'

# Below is wild card matching example. All messageTypes for WMA.EAST should be converted to GS1. 
# This is a 1st match list. Ops need to make sure that wild card entry is appearing after named lists.
# As if we put line 19 before line 12 , we wil lnot get the desired result as all messageTypes will be matched for GS1 
# where as intention was to convert <itemMessage|locationMessage|orderMessage> to BYDM and rest to GS1 but since wildcard matches all , named list will never be matched.

- 'Wma.EAST:*:GS1'
- 'TMA.WEST:itemMessage|locationMessage:BYDM'
- 'TMA.WEST:*:GS1'
- 'LOC.DOC0001:*:GS3'
